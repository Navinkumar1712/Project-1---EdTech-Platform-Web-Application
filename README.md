Automated Testing Framework for [GUVI Web Application](https://www.guvi.in)

## Project Overview
This project focuses on automating the testing of the **GUVI web application** using modern test automation practices.  
It simulates real user interactions and validates the **UI, navigation flows, accessibility of critical elements, and login functionalities** across multiple browsers.  

The framework is built using **Python, Selenium, and Pytest**, and follows a scalable **Page Object Model (POM)** design to ensure maintainability and reusability.

## Key Features
- Cross-browser testing on Chrome, Firefox, and Edge  
- Parallel execution of test cases for faster feedback  
- Page Object Model (POM) for clean and structured test design  
- Data-driven testing with configuration and property files  
- Pytest Fixtures (`conftest.py`) for setup and teardown  
- Explicit & Fluent waits for handling dynamic elements  
- Robust exception handling using `try-except-finally` blocks  
- Detailed HTML Reports with test results and environment info  
- Logging support for debugging and traceability  
- Automatic screenshots on failure for better defect analysis
